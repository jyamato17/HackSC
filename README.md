I participated in HackSC during the spring of 2019. We created improved a preexisting algorithm for a company called Totle. This algorithm tracked the price conversion between two cryptocurrencies Ethereum and Dai.

We implemented changes to the algorithm to improve their real time tracking price and also to prevent flash crashes from trading bots or attacks on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Another goal that we sought to improve was their subscription model, and we modified their subscription fee so that more users will be incentivized to use this service.

The other file is our deliverable to Totle and dives deeper into the problems and solutions stated above.
